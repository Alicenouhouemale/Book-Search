## Description

Book Search Engine is a site in which users can search for any book title or author, and search results containing their query will appear below. In this project, I integrate a GraphQL API into a fully functioning book engine that was built using the MERN stack, replacing the previous RESTful API.

This assignment includes:

1. Setting up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API,
2. Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API,
3. Creating an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server, and
4. Deploying the application to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.
